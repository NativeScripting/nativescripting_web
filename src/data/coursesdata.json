            "subtitle": "Sharing your web and native mobile application code",
            "description": "This course is for those that need to be able to have as much code reuse as possible between their Angular applications for the web and their native mobile apps written with NativeScript and Angular. You will learn how to leverage NPM scripts, naming conventions, and a smart application folder structure for maximum reusability between your code bases and use the monorepo approach to do it. Even if you aren't sharing web and NativeScript code, this course shows some best practices in architecting your solution when it comes to Angular with NativeScript.\n\nIn this intermediate level course, Paul Halliday quickly explains some of the concepts behind code sharing and then dives right into a sample project, which he builds from scratch.\n\n\n",
